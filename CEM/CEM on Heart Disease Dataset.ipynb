This method is applicable for classification datasets. CEM gives two kinds of explanations: \n","\n","Pertinent Positives (PP): For a PP, the method finds the features that should be minimally and sufficiently present (e.g. important pixels in an image) to predict the same class as on the original instance.  PP works similarly to Anchors.\n","\n","\n","Pertinent Negatives (PN): PN’s on the other hand identify what features should be minimally and necessarily absent from the instance to be explained in order to maintain the original prediction class. The aim of PN’s is not to provide a full set of characteristics that should be absent in the explained instance, but to identify a minimal set of features that is enough to differentiate it from the nearest different class. PN works similarly to Counterfactuals.\n","\n","\n","\n","\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"DhemwDPujHbk","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1601735403695,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":17463,"user":{"displayName":"Smiti
